# "Are You Depressed?"
This is an application with a simple premise: **create an API for my depression**.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheJokersThief/AreYouDepressed-/master/public/images/og-image.png)

What happens is that every four hours (outside of 10PM-8AM), I receive an email with a single question: "Are you depressed?" and I either click yes or no and my choice is reflected on the website.

At any point, I can add a new entry or change the settings from an admin panel on the website.

##Example
You can view the site at [depressed.evan.netsoc.co](http://depressed.evan.netsoc.co/) and the admin section at [depressed.evan.netsoc.co/admin](http://depressed.evan.netsoc.co/admin).

### JSON Endpoints
* Current state: [depressed.evan.netsoc.co/json](http://depressed.evan.netsoc.co/json)
* All past states: [depressed.evan.netsoc.co/json/all](http://depressed.evan.netsoc.co/json/all)

## The Design
* The fonts for the site are inspired by [TufteCSS](https://github.com/edwardtufte/tufte-css)
* The particles are from [ParticleJS](https://github.com/VincentGarreau/particles.js/)
	* I got the idea of the particles from [Colm Cahalane](http://colm.cf)

There are different designs for either option.
### Yes
When I am depressed, the background is sullen and blue while the particles in the background move very slowly with very few particles in total.

### No
When I am the opposite, the background is bright and warm with the particles being many and swift in their movements
